# Hi! I'm Michael, studying CS at Stanford.
 
- Some projects I'm currently working on are:
  - **[cardFlash](https://github.com/amichaelyu/cardFlash)**: a Flutter-based free flashcard app.
- I've worked extensively with **Java**; integrating software PID control, logging, fiducial-based localization system, and state machines with hardware such as global shutter cameras, IMUs, and brushless motors for **[FRC](https://github.com/pittsfordrobotics/ChargedUp2023/tree/master)**.
- I've also experimented with **Python**, writing low-level machine learning code such as **[gradient descent](https://github.com/amichaelyu/gradiant-decent)** and **[normal equation](https://github.com/amichaelyu/normal-equation)** functions.
- I've also used **App Script** to build an automated **[pairing system](https://github.com/amichaelyu/RPT-pairing)** for a local tutoring organization.
